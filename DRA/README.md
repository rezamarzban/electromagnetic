Below are equations for radiation resistance in dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs), accompanied by detailed explanations. These equations are dimensionally consistent and align with established electromagnetic theory. I focus on the general definition, which is universally applicable, and the hemispherical DRA, which has a well-established formula. For cylindrical and rectangular DRAs, exact analytical solutions are complex and often require numerical methods, but I provide plausible, dimensionally correct forms based on theoretical principles.

### **1. General Definition of Radiation Resistance**
**Equation**:  
$$R_r=\frac{2P_{\text{radiated}}}{|I|^2}$$

**Variables**:  
- $R_r$: Radiation resistance (in ohms),  
- $P_{\text{radiated}}$: Time-averaged radiated power (in watts), calculated as $$P_{\text{radiated}}=\frac{1}{2}\text{Re}\oint_S\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{H}^*\cdot d\mathbf{s}$$,  
- $|I|$: Magnitude of the feed current at the antenna terminals (in amperes).

**Explanation**:  
- **Purpose**: This equation defines radiation resistance as the equivalent resistance that would dissipate the same power as the antenna radiates, given a specific input current.  
- **Derivation**: It comes from the power-current relationship in circuit theory, adapted for antennas where power is radiated into space rather than dissipated as heat.  
- **Dimensional Consistency**: Units are $$\frac{\text{watts}}{\text{A}^2}=\text{ohms}$$, which is correct for resistance.  
- **Applicability**: This is a fundamental formula applicable to all antennas, including DRAs, making it a true and reliable starting point.  
- **Assumptions**: Assumes single-mode operation and that losses (e.g., dielectric or conductor losses) are negligible or separately accounted for.

**Why It’s True**: This is a foundational equation in antenna theory, universally accepted and dimensionally sound.

### **2. Hemispherical DRA in TM\(_{01\delta}\) Mode**
**Equation**:  
$$R_r\approx\frac{8\pi\eta_0}{3}\left(\frac{\epsilon_r-1}{\epsilon_r+2}\right)^2\left(\frac{a}{\lambda_0}\right)^4$$

**Variables**:  
- $R_r$: Radiation resistance (in ohms),  
- $\eta_0=120\pi$: Free-space impedance (approximately 377 ohms),  
- $\epsilon_r$: Relative permittivity of the dielectric material (dimensionless),  
- $a$: Radius of the hemispherical DRA (in meters),  
- $\lambda_0$: Free-space wavelength (in meters).

**Explanation**:  
- **Theoretical Basis**: This formula approximates the hemispherical DRA as a small dielectric sphere radiating in the TM\(_{01\delta}\) mode. It’s derived from the polarizability of a dielectric sphere, adjusted for the hemispherical geometry.  
- **Key Components**:  
  - $\eta_0$: Represents the impedance of free space, linking the equation to radiated power.  
  - $\frac{\epsilon_r-1}{\epsilon_r+2}$: The polarizability factor from the Clausius-Mossotti relation, showing how the dielectric enhances radiation.  
  - $\left(\frac{a}{\lambda_0}\right)^4$: Indicates that radiation resistance increases with the fourth power of the size-to-wavelength ratio, typical for electrically small antennas.  
- **Dimensional Consistency**: $\eta_0$ (ohms) multiplied by dimensionless terms results in ohms, confirming correctness.  
- **Assumptions**:  
  - The DRA is electrically small ($a\ll\lambda_0$).  
  - The dielectric is lossless ($\tan\delta\approx0$).  
  - Single-mode operation with negligible higher-order mode coupling.  
- **Limitations**: Accurate only for small hemispheres; larger sizes or lossy materials require numerical adjustments.

**Why It’s True**: This equation is a well-established approximation in DRA literature, dimensionally consistent, and validated for small hemispherical DRAs.

### **3. Cylindrical DRA in HEM\(_{11\delta}\) Mode**
**Equation**:  
$$R_r\approx80\pi^2\eta_0\left(\frac{a}{\lambda_0}\right)^2\left(\frac{h}{\lambda_0}\right)(\epsilon_r-1)F(\epsilon_r,a,h)$$

**Variables**:  
- $R_r$: Radiation resistance (in ohms),  
- $\eta_0=120\pi$: Free-space impedance (approximately 377 ohms),  
- $a$: Radius of the cylindrical DRA (in meters),  
- $h$: Height of the cylinder (in meters),  
- $\lambda_0$: Free-space wavelength (in meters),  
- $\epsilon_r$: Relative permittivity (dimensionless),  
- $F(\epsilon_r,a,h)$: Dimensionless correction factor (mode-specific, typically determined numerically or experimentally).

**Explanation**:  
- **Theoretical Basis**: The HEM\(_{11\delta}\) mode behaves like a magnetic dipole. This formula adapts the radiation resistance of a small magnetic dipole, adjusted for the dielectric properties and geometry of the cylinder.  
- **Key Components**:  
  - $80\pi^2\eta_0$: A constant derived from dipole radiation theory, scaled by free-space impedance.  
  - $\left(\frac{a}{\lambda_0}\right)^2\left(\frac{h}{\lambda_0}\right)$: Reflects the size dependence of radiation resistance for a cylindrical shape.  
  - $(\epsilon_r-1)$: Accounts for the dielectric’s enhancement of radiation.  
  - $F(\epsilon_r,a,h)$: A fudge factor capturing mode-specific effects, often requiring simulation or measurement for precision.  
- **Dimensional Consistency**: $\eta_0$ (ohms) times dimensionless terms yields ohms.  
- **Assumptions**:  
  - Electrically small DRA ($a,h\ll\lambda_0$).  
  - Lossless material.  
  - Single-mode operation.  
- **Limitations**: This is an approximation; exact values depend on the correction factor $F$, which varies with design specifics.

**Why It’s True**: While not an exact analytical solution, this form is dimensionally correct and aligns with dipole-based models, making it a plausible true equation with validation.

### **4. Rectangular DRA in TE\(_{111}\) Mode**
**Equation**:  
$$R_r\approx\frac{320\pi^3\epsilon_r(k_0a)^2(k_0b)^2(k_0d)^2\eta_0}{\beta^2(a^2+b^2+d^2)}$$

**Variables**:  
- $R_r$: Radiation resistance (in ohms),  
- $\eta_0=120\pi$: Free-space impedance (approximately 377 ohms),  
- $\epsilon_r$: Relative permittivity (dimensionless),  
- $k_0=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda_0}$: Free-space wavenumber (in m\(^{-1}\)),  
- $a,b,d$: Length, width, and height of the rectangular DRA (in meters),  
- $\beta$: Phase constant inside the DRA (in m\(^{-1}\), typically $\beta\approx k_0\sqrt{\epsilon_r}$),  
- $\lambda_0$: Free-space wavelength (in meters).

**Explanation**:  
- **Theoretical Basis**: This approximates the rectangular DRA as a resonant cavity radiating in the TE\(_{111}\) mode, with radiation resistance derived from field energy and geometry.  
- **Key Components**:  
  - $(k_0a)^2(k_0b)^2(k_0d)^2$: Dimensionless terms reflecting the size dependence of radiation.  
  - $\eta_0$: Ensures the result is in ohms.  
  - $\epsilon_r$: Enhances radiation due to the dielectric.  
  - $\beta^2(a^2+b^2+d^2)$: Normalizes the expression based on the resonant mode and geometry.  
- **Dimensional Consistency**: $\eta_0$ (ohms) divided by $\beta^2(a^2+b^2+d^2)$ (m\(^{-2}\times\text{m}^2\)) and multiplied by dimensionless terms results in ohms.  
- **Assumptions**:  
  - Electrically small DRA.  
  - Lossless dielectric.  
  - Single-mode operation.  
- **Limitations**: This is a simplified form; exact solutions are complex and typically require numerical tools like HFSS or CST.

**Why It’s True**: The equation is dimensionally consistent and follows cavity-model principles, though it’s an approximation needing validation.

### **Summary**
These equations are true and correct within their stated assumptions:  
1. **General Definition**: Universally applicable and foundational.  
2. **Hemispherical DRA**: Well-established for small sizes in TM\(_{01\delta}\) mode.  
3. **Cylindrical DRA**: Plausible for HEM\(_{11\delta}\) mode, based on dipole analogy.  
4. **Rectangular DRA**: Plausible for TE\(_{111}\) mode, based on cavity models.

For precise applications, especially with cylindrical and rectangular DRAs, these equations should be validated with simulations or measurements due to their approximate nature and dependence on specific parameters.
