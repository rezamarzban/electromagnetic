To compute the magnitude squared of the electric field component $E_z$, we start with the given expression:

$$E_z=-j\frac{Z_{\text{earth}}k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\sin\phi\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}}e^{-jk_0d}$$

The magnitude squared of a complex number $E_z$ is defined as $|E_z|^2 = E_z\cdot E_z^* $, where $E_z^*$ is the complex conjugate of $E_z$. Alternatively, since $E_z$ is a complex number, its magnitude squared is the product of its amplitude terms, with all phase factors (which have a magnitude of 1) removed. Let's compute $$|E_z|^2$$ step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Components of $E_z$
The expression for $E_z$ contains several terms:
- $-j$: The imaginary unit $j$ (where $j=i$ in engineering notation), so $-j=-i$, a phase factor.
- $\frac{Z_{\text{earth}}k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\sin\phi\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}}$: A combination of parameters that we’ll denote as $A$.
- $e^{-jk_0d}$: An exponential phase factor.

Thus, we can write:

$$E_z=-j\cdot A\cdot e^{-jk_0d}$$

where:

$$A=\frac{Z_{\text{earth}}k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\sin\phi\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}}$$

### Step 2: Determine if $A$ is Real
To find the magnitude, we need to check whether $A$ is real, as this affects how we handle the conjugation. Let’s examine each component of $A$:
- $Z_{\text{earth}}$: The impedance of the earth, typically real in this context (though it could be complex in some cases, we assume it’s real here unless specified otherwise).
- $k_0$: The wave number, $$k_0=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$$, a real and positive constant in free space.
- $I_0$: The current amplitude, a real number.
- $l$: The length, a real and positive physical quantity.
- $h$: The height, a real and positive quantity.
- $\sin\phi$: The sine of an angle $\phi$, a real number (can be positive or negative depending on $\phi$).
- $\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}}$: Since $\pi$, $k_0$, and $d$ (distance) are real and positive, this square root is real and positive.

Since all components are real, $A$ is a real number. Its sign depends on $\sin\phi$, but this will not affect the magnitude squared, as we’ll see.

### Step 3: Compute the Complex Conjugate $E_z^*$
Now, let’s find the complex conjugate of $E_z$:
- $$E_z=-jAe^{-jk_0d}$$
- The conjugate of $-j=-i$ is $$(-i)^* =i$$ (since $$i^* =-i$$, and the negative sign conjugates to positive).
- $A$ is real, so $$A^*=A$$.
- The conjugate of $e^{-jk_0d}$ is $$(e^{-jk_0d})^*=e^{jk_0d}$$, because the exponent’s imaginary part changes sign.

Thus:

$$E_z^* =(-j)^* A^* (e^{-jk_0d})^* =iAe^{jk_0d}$$

### Step 4: Calculate $$|E_z|^2=E_z\cdot E_z^*$$
Now, compute the product:

$$|E_z|^2=E_z\cdot E_z^*=(-jAe^{-jk_0d})\cdot(iAe^{jk_0d})$$

Break it down:
- $-j\cdot i=-i\cdot i=-i^2=-(-1)=1$
- $A\cdot A=A^2$ (since $A$ is real)
- $$e^{-jk_0d}\cdot e^{jk_0d}=e^{(-jk_0d)+(jk_0d)}=e^0=1$$

So:

$$|E_z|^2=1\cdot A^2\cdot 1=A^2$$

### Step 5: Substitute $A$ Back In
Substitute the expression for $A$:

$$A=\frac{Z_{\text{earth}}k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\sin\phi\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}}$$

Then:

$$A^2=\left(\frac{Z_{\text{earth}}k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\sin\phi\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}}\right)^2$$

Square each term:
- $$\left(\frac{Z_{\text{earth}}k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\right)^2=\left(\frac{Z_{\text{earth}}k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\right)^2$$
- $$(\sin\phi)^2=\sin^2\phi$$
- $$\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}}\right)^2=\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}$$

Thus:

$$|E_z|^2=\left(\frac{Z_{\text{earth}}k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\right)^2\sin^2\phi\cdot\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}$$

### Step 6: Alternative Approach (Magnitude Directly)
Alternatively, recognize that $$|E_z|=|-j|\cdot|A|\cdot|e^{-jk_0d}|$$:
- $$|-j|=1$$ (since $$|-i|=\sqrt{(-i)\cdot(i)}=\sqrt{1}=1$$)
- $$|e^{-jk_0d}|=1$$ (exponential phase terms have magnitude 1)
- $$|A|=\left|\frac{Z_{\text{earth}}k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\sin\phi\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}}\right|$$, and since all terms are real, this is just $A$ (absolute value handles the sign of $\sin\phi$)

So, $$|E_z|=|A|$$, and $$|E_z|^2=A^2$$, which matches our result.

### Final Result 
The magnitude squared of the electric field $E_z$ is:

$$|E_z|^2=\left(\frac{Z_{\text{earth}}k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\right)^2\sin^2\phi\frac{\pi}{2k_0d}$$

This expression accounts for all terms, with the phase factors $-j$ and $e^{-jk_0d}$ contributing only to the phase, not the magnitude. The result is consistent with physical expectations, as $\sin^2\phi$ ensures a non-negative magnitude squared, and all other parameters are typically positive in this context.

## cylindrical spreading

Let’s dive into explaining cylindrical spreading in detail, with a particular focus on how the phase term $e^{-j(k_gd-m\pi/2-\pi/4)}$ from the Hankel function simplifies to $e^{-jk_gd}$ in the expression for the vertical electric field $E_z$. This involves understanding cylindrical wave propagation and the mathematical simplifications that occur in specific contexts, such as waveguides or far-field approximations.

### Understanding Cylindrical Spreading

**Cylindrical spreading** refers to how waves propagate radially outward from a line source (or an equivalent 2D source) in a two-dimensional plane, as opposed to the spherical spreading seen from a point source in three dimensions. In 3D spherical spreading, the wave amplitude decreases as $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance from the source, due to the surface area of a sphere scaling as $r^2$. In 2D cylindrical spreading, the wavefront forms a cylinder around the line source, and the circumference of this cylinder scales linearly with the radial distance $d$. Conservation of energy then suggests that the power per unit length along the cylinder is constant, leading to an amplitude decay proportional to $1/\sqrt{d}$. This is a hallmark of cylindrical waves and distinguishes them from spherical waves.

Mathematically, cylindrical wave propagation is described using Bessel functions in cylindrical coordinates $(d,\phi,z)$, where $d$ is the radial distance from the source axis, $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle, and $z$ is the coordinate along the source axis (often uniform for a line source). For outgoing waves—those traveling away from the source—the radial dependence is governed by the Hankel function of the second kind, $H_m^{(2)}(k_gd)$, where:
- $k_g$ is the radial wavenumber, determining the spatial frequency of the wave in the radial direction.
- $m$ is the order of the Hankel function, corresponding to the angular dependence (e.g., $m=0$ for no angular variation, $m=1$ for $\sin\phi$ or $\cos\phi$ dependence).
- $d$ is the radial distance from the source.

The Hankel function $H_m^{(2)}(k_gd)$ represents an outgoing cylindrical wave, and its behavior changes depending on the value of $k_gd$. For our purposes, we’re interested in the **far-field region**, where $k_gd\gg1$, meaning the observation point is many wavelengths away from the source.

### Asymptotic Form of the Hankel Function

In the far field ($k_gd\gg1$), the Hankel function has a well-known asymptotic approximation:

$$H_m^{(2)}(k_gd)\approx\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi k_gd}}e^{-j(k_gd-\frac{m\pi}{2}-\frac{\pi}{4})}$$

Let’s break this down:

1. **Amplitude Term**: $\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi k_gd}}$
   - This term shows the $1/\sqrt{d}$ decay characteristic of cylindrical spreading. The factor $\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi k_g}}$ is a constant that normalizes the amplitude based on the wavenumber and mathematical convention.

2. **Phase Term**: $e^{-j(k_gd-\frac{m\pi}{2}-\frac{\pi}{4})}$
   - This exponential represents the phase of the wave as it propagates outward. We can rewrite it as:
     $$e^{-j(k_gd-\frac{m\pi}{2}-\frac{\pi}{4})}=e^{-jk_gd}e^{j(\frac{m\pi}{2}+\frac{\pi}{4})}$$
   - $e^{-jk_gd}$: The propagation phase, indicating the wave advances with a phase shift proportional to the distance $d$ and wavenumber $k_g$. The negative sign aligns with the time convention $e^{j\omega t}$, common in engineering, where $H_m^{(2)}$ represents outgoing waves.
   - $e^{j(\frac{m\pi}{2}+\frac{\pi}{4})}$: An additional phase shift that depends on the order $m$ and a fixed offset of $\pi/4$, arising from the asymptotic expansion of the Hankel function.

This form confirms that the cylindrical wave has both the expected amplitude decay and a complex phase that includes propagation and mode-specific shifts.

### The Query: Simplification to $e^{-jk_gd}$ in $E_z$

Now, the query asks why the phase term $e^{-j(k_gd-m\pi/2-\pi/4)}$ from the Hankel function becomes simply $e^{-jk_gd}$ in the expression for $E_z$. Let’s assume $E_z$ represents the vertical electric field component in a specific problem, such as a waveguide excited by a horizontal dipole, with an expression like:

$$E_z\approx-j\frac{\eta_0k_0I_0l}{2\pi h}\sin\phi\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_gd}}e^{-jk_gd}$$

Here, the phase is $e^{-jk_gd}$, and there’s no sign of the additional $e^{j(m\pi/2+\pi/4)}$ term. To understand this, we need to explore how the field is derived and why the phase simplifies.

#### Step 1: Context of the Field
The expression for $E_z$ suggests a transverse magnetic (TM) mode in a parallel-plate waveguide or a similar 2D structure, excited by a horizontal dipole (indicated by the $\sin\phi$ term, implying $m=1$). In such systems, the field is often expressed as a sum of modes, each with a radial dependence given by $H_m^{(2)}(k_gd)$, where $k_g$ is the radial wavenumber for the dominant mode (e.g., $k_g=\sqrt{k_0^2-(n\pi/h)^2}$ for mode $n$ in a waveguide of height $h$)).

For $m=1$ (due to $\sin\phi$):
$$H_1^{(2)}(k_gd)\approx\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi k_gd}}e^{-j(k_gd-\frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{\pi}{4})}$$
$$=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi k_gd}}e^{-jk_gd}e^{j(\frac{\pi}{2}+\frac{\pi}{4})}$$
$$=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi k_gd}}e^{-jk_gd}e^{j\frac{3\pi}{4}}$$

The phase includes $e^{j\frac{3\pi}{4}}$, a complex constant ($e^{j3\pi/4}=-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}+j\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$), but $E_z$ shows only $e^{-jk_gd}$.

#### Step 2: Absorbing the Extra Phase
The key to the simplification lies in the **overall field expression**. The Hankel function is just one part of $E_z$; the full field includes amplitude coefficients, source terms, and possibly other factors from the derivation. In many electromagnetic problems:
- The field is derived using a Green’s function or modal expansion.
- Asymptotic methods (e.g., stationary phase or saddle point approximation) are applied for large $d$.
- The resulting expression is written in a standard form where the propagation phase is $e^{-jk_gd}$, and additional phases are absorbed into a complex amplitude.

In the given $E_z$, notice the prefactor:
- $-j=e^{-j\pi/2}$, a phase factor.
- $\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_gd}}$, an amplitude term that differs from the standard $\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi k_gd}}$, suggesting a specific normalization or adjustment.

The extra phase $e^{j(m\pi/2+\pi/4)}$ can be combined with these factors. For $m=1$:
$$e^{j(\frac{\pi}{2}+\frac{\pi}{4})}=e^{j\frac{3\pi}{4}}$$
If multiplied by $-j$:
$$-j\cdot e^{j\frac{3\pi}{4}}=e^{-j\frac{\pi}{2}}\cdot e^{j\frac{3\pi}{4}}=e^{j(\frac{3\pi}{4}-\frac{\pi}{2})}=e^{j\frac{\pi}{4}}$$

This doesn’t cancel to 1, so let’s reconsider. The simplification likely arises because the derivation (e.g., via Green’s function or mode summation) adjusts the phase convention. In 2D problems, the far-field form is often written as:
$$E_z\propto\frac{e^{-jk_gd}}{\sqrt{k_gd}}$$
where the amplitude coefficient (including $-j$, $\sin\phi$, etc.) incorporates all constant phase shifts.

#### Step 3: Waveguide Derivation Insight
In a waveguide, $E_z$ for a TM mode might come from a Green’s function like $G(d)=\frac{j}{4}H_0^{(1)}(k_gd)$ (for $e^{-j\omega t}$ convention), but adjusted for $H_m^{(2)}$ and the dipole’s orientation. The asymptotic form is manipulated so that:
- The $1/\sqrt{d}$ dependence remains.
- The phase $e^{-jk_gd}$ represents propagation, and extra terms (e.g., $e^{j(m\pi/2+\pi/4)}$) are part of the complex amplitude.

The $-j$ factor and the unusual $\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_gd}}$ suggest a specific derivation choice, possibly matching boundary conditions or normalizing the mode, absorbing the Hankel function’s extra phase.

---

### Final Explanation

In cylindrical spreading, the Hankel function $H_m^{(2)}(k_gd)$ describes the radial wave with:
- Amplitude $\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi k_gd}}$, reflecting the $1/\sqrt{d}$ decay.
- Phase $e^{-j(k_gd-m\pi/2-\pi/4)}$, including propagation and mode-dependent shifts.

For $E_z$ to have only $e^{-jk_gd}$:
- The additional phase $e^{j(m\pi/2+\pi/4)}$ is absorbed into the complex amplitude (e.g., $-j\cdot\text{constants}$).
- The derivation—likely involving a waveguide mode or asymptotic approximation—conventionally isolates $e^{-jk_gd}$ as the propagation term, adjusting the prefactor accordingly.

Thus, the transition from $e^{-j(k_gd-m\pi/2-\pi/4)}$ to $e^{-jk_gd}$ reflects a practical simplification where the extra phase is embedded in the field’s amplitude, consistent with cylindrical wave behavior in the far field.
